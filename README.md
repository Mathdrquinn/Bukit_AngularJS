An exercise in AngularJS using CRUD with $http
----------------------------------------------

Keeping in mind the focus of the assignment (not css), I found it to be a challenging and rewarding excercise.
I had to relate to separate databases yet have them communicate as one to affect one another's properties.  Angular's
views allow this web applicaiton great performace.
